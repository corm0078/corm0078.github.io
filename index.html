          <h3>Say Emotion</h3>
            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p>The challenge was creating a series of Emoji that would pop out to the user based on emotions.  Finding the correct Emoji on today's mobile phones should be simple but with the lack of colours and important features makes the task hard. The new icons needed to create an instant emotion from the user.</p>

            <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>The solution was creating Icons that would be recognize based on colour profiles mostly, then the user could select a more specific feeling . The bring colours reflect moods like red for anger or blue for sadness appealing the users psychological aspect. The Eyes were also made to be an important part of the icons by making them bigger and adding eyebrows. These little changes made it easier for the viewer to spot their icons. </p>

              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>The challenge was creating a personal branding that would represent myself and my reason for being a graphic designer as a hole. The logo needed to be classic and say something about the person and design I am and would like to become in the future. </p>

              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>The solution was a Post-It ,I love to think of the idea behind the design the reason, the communication of the idea is why I love design. The Post-it shape came from there Post-it are a communication method and that is how I saw this square behind my name. The Letters just came together afterwards as a geometrical shape almost that would represent myself and everything that makes me who I am with the colours. The colours are constantly  changing as am I.  </p>

          <h3>Young Jane</h3>
          <h4>The Challenge</h4>
          <p>Young Jane needed a logo that would appeal to their target audience  with a young and fun design that would remind of the vintage old days without being old itself. The logo needed to  create a sense of recognition for the company.</p>
          <img class="flex-img" src="http://placekitten.com/350/250" alt="img">
          <img class="flex-img"src="http://placekitten.com/350/250"alt="img">
          <h4>The Solution</h4>
          <p>The solution was creating the image of any woman so that the Young Jane customer could see herself in those shoes and ultimately decide to go to the shop. The brand colours were vintage colours that would capture the eye while helping define the woman figure and bring it to the next level. The half circle was added in order to create a link between the woman and the text making the logo stronger. This logo will stand the test of time and help the target audience relate with the Young Jane identity.</p>

                  <h3 class="center">Creative Process</h3>
                    <p>The creative process is my favorite part it is not just about the idea but how you got to the idea.  Being a graphic designer is much more then having ideas its conveying a message through the idea to another person. This all begins in at this stage of the process.</p>
              </div>

                  <h3 class="center">Design</h3>
                    <p>Designing is the most rewarding part of the process, getting your ideas to come to life on a screen or on a piece of paper is great. The design part might be challenging at time but its definitely worth the sweat and tears. From print to web nothing is off limits for me, design is fun no mater what the medium may be.</p>

                  <h3 class="center">Interaction</h3>
                <p>After working on something for so long there is nothing better then showing it to peer or the target market/user to see what they think how you could improve it in the future. After all a project is never finished and improvements are just a small part in becoming the best designer possible.</p>
